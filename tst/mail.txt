Dear Sir, It is Park.
I met you on the catamaran boat.

I was very happy to have such a deep dialog with you.
I wanted some extended talk but, there was too much noise.
So I continue here.

Jesus Christ's sayings are text. 
So it can be interpreted in many ways.
Even in christian traditions, there were many ways of interpreting it.
Some were considered as heresy, but those choices were made by human decisions.
Even if there is a creator, I don't think he should preside over what we do as our parents should not preside over what we should do.
He should remain as a solicitor not as a coercer.
And I don't think he can override the law of Universe like morality and cause and effect.

Let's say that there is a super power that can do as he wants and as he wills.
And what he wants have no necessary relation to morality.
Then I do not need to serve that super power even as a mere human. 
And how can I discern that entity from devil.
If christianism is like that, it is no different from worshipping a tyrant.
Because god is righteous, we can worship him.
Not because he have power or he created us.
In that sense, I can say that what is important is not the god, but -what we may call this- the law of universe.
So we should not exclude people that do not know Jesus or do not believe in his being savior.
Even pope has admitted that people can be saved by other means.
Nontheless some christian sects exclude good people just because he is not a christian.
I think some evil forces are using the holy Jesus' saying to his taste.
Historically many wars and discriminations were done in the name of religions.
If someone says you should blindly follow my order to enter heaven, I would say that he is probably not a god, but a devil.
I know no other way to discern god and devil than the righteousness.

I will wait for your reply about my opinion.
Happy travel !!!
